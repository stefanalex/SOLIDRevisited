// a bicycle is a transportation device, however, it does not have an engine and hence, 
//the method startEngine() cannot be implemented.
//These are the kinds of problems that violation of Liskov Substitution Principle leads to, 
//and they can most usually be recognized by a method that does nothing, or even canâ€™t be implemented.
//The solution to these problems is a correct inheritance hierarchy, and in our case we would solve the problem by differentiating classes of transportation devices with and without engines.
